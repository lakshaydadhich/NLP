Sentiment Analysis of Food Reviews Using NLP
Project Description
This project focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) to perform sentiment analysis on food reviews. The goal is to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral based on the textual data. The project demonstrates the end-to-end pipeline for sentiment analysis, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training.

Key Features:
Dataset: The project uses a dataset of food reviews (NLP-food-review.csv) containing text reviews and their corresponding sentiment labels.
Text Preprocessing: Includes tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and vectorization techniques (e.g., TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer).
Modeling: Implements machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Neural Networks to classify sentiments.
Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Tools and Libraries:
Python: Core programming language for implementation.
Libraries: NLTK, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.
Objectives:
Understand and preprocess textual data for sentiment classification.
Compare various machine learning algorithms to find the most effective one for this task.
Demonstrate a practical NLP workflow that can be extended to other text analysis problems.
